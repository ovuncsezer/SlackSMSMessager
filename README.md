# SlackSMSMessager
A Android app to send SMS messages to Slack and Slack messages as SMS.

Wrote this app to be able to communicate with my lovely girlfriend since I was going to be in a place without a smartphone but with an ancient cell phone from 90's. My only communication channel was SMS so I had to wrote an app that which sends the message received from an SMS to Slack and vice versa. This way, we were able to communicate with my girlfriend and we missed each othe less :)
